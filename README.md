# Image Classification
Creation of a classifier that can identify the label of a fashion product image using convolutional neural networks.

# Part 1: Image Classification using CNN
A basic CNN model that can identify if an image is related to the 13 subcategories among 44,441 fashion product images:  
Topwear, Bottomwear, Innerwear, Bags, Watches, Jewellery, Eyewear, Wallets, Shoes, Sandal, Makeup, Fragrance, Others.

Images contain distinct meta-data labels (image id, label, productDisplayName). 

Training Accuracy = 89.5%

Testing Accuracy = 89.6%

# Part 2: Improved Image Classification
Improve the base CNN model proposed in Part 1.

Testing Accuracy = 92.6%
